### Engineering Demonstration Videos
- **3D CAD Motion Simulation**  
  This video showcases the steering mechanism and differential in motion using Autodesk Fusion CAD simulation. Used for mechanical design documentation.  
  *File*: [3d_CAD_motion.mp4](3d_CAD_motion.mp4)

- **Differential Test**  
  This video demonstrates the functionality of the custom 4-gear mechanical differential. Used for mechanical design documentation.  
  *File*: [differential_test.mp4](differential_test.mp4)

## Video Features
- **Complete Performance Documentation**: Each challenge video shows the entire run from initiation to completion
- **Professional Presentation**: All videos include overlay commentary and captions explaining mobility management, sensor operations, and obstacle management with navigation strategies
- **Technical Demonstrations**: Supplementary videos provide additional insight into mechanical systems and design validation
- **High Quality**: 4K resolution with clear visibility of all vehicle operations and sensor interactions

## Notes
- Competition performance videos for Open and Obstacle Challenges are uploaded to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@solipsy.) in high resolution (4K) and are publicly accessible
- All videos include professional editing with clear visual demonstrations of our engineering solutions
- Engineering demonstration videos (3d_CAD_motion.mp4, differential_test.mp4) are local files used for supplementary documentation in other README files and available for download in this folder
